# Tagme


1. Design a cross-platform(Windows/Ubuntu) software, named "Tagme", to tag images.

2. Tagme is highly optimized on tagging images. For example, the pre-defined tagged can be mapped to a single key in the computer keyboard. A user can asign a tag to an image by samply hitting a key, then Tagme automatically show the next image. So the all the user needs to do is only hitting a key to indicate the tag of the shown image. This is no other operation such as zoomming or moving to the next images.

3. Tips:
  -.The use can decide show the tag-key table not not.
